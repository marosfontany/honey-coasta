                    some time as well, so for more than 10 years, he has been developing his skills as a guitar player. But his inner 
                    artist wouldn't let him stop at only playing the guitar.

                <p>The stage name Honeycoasta is a multilayered description of what Honeycoasta is, what he does and what inspires him. “Honey” part of the name symbolises the artist’s love for nature and all things 
                    simple. Real is beautiful after all. “Coasta” part was 
                    born out of his misspelled birth name on a Starbucks 
                    cup. The word symbolises the latin music influence 
                    in his works as well as sunbathing 
                    under the Lithuanian sun. </p>

            <h1>inspirations</h1>
                <p>During the 3 years of playing in various bands, HoneyCoasta explored 
                    many genres like psychedelic rock, funk, progressive rock, indie & jazz-rock. However, his personal sound grew out of such genres as indie rock, bosa nova, and jazz. <span id="dots3">...</span><span id="more3"> HoneyCoasta points out that the most influential artists to him are people like Tom Misch, Marcos Valle, and Oscar Jerome. Lyrically he is inspired by the perfect world of simplicity - nature. Reflected in 
                    his artworks, the beach, the Lithuanian fields & lakes, and the comfort of home 
                    are what inspire HoneyCoasta to write, play and create in general.
